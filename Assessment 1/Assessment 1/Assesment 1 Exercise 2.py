## Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks

#In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

### Steps:
# 1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
# 2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
# 3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
# 4. Print the value of the sum to the console.

print("Exercise 2") 
num1 = 8 # Step 1 assigns num1 as integer value 8.
num2 = 10 # Step 2 assingns num2 as integer value 10
sum = num1 + num2 # Step 3 declares the sum of num1 and num2 in a single variable.

print(sum) # Step 4 print the value of the sum to the console.
